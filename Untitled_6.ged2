1 CONC pect that Gorringe Terrace was actually Gorringe Park Terrace.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The 1892 and 1909/10 Kelly’s directories do not show any street / housin

0 @N0044@ NOTE Rymans name in the Richards family:
1 CONT 
1 CONT It was thought by Derick Cheeseman that the name Ryman that appeared i

1 CONC lf-service stationery shop in London at Great Portland Street in 1893. H
1 CONC owever, my research has found little evidence to support this.
1 CONT 
1 CONT My research shows that the name Ryman began to appear during the marriag
1 CONC e of William Emmanuel Richards and Thurza Hannah Earl. Between them the
1 CONC y had ten children of which six would have the name Ryman in their nam
1 CONC e with the first appearance going to the third child, Gilbert (born, yea
1 CONC r 1876).
1 CONT 
1 CONT William Emmanuel Richards and Henry John Ryman where born just three yea
1 CONC rs apart but relatively speaking for that period they lived miles apart
1 CONC . William born in 1849 and residing in Oxford and Henry born in 1852 an
1 CONC d residing in London.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Neither William Richards or Thurza Earl have a parent with the name Ryma
1 CONC n.
1 CONT 
1 CONT However, William Emmanuel Richards occupation as stated in the 1881 Cenc
1 CONC us was Printseller Publisher & Carver & Gilder. Could this occupation b
1 CONC e a link?
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to the 1901 census, Gilbert Ryman Richards (born 1876) was res
1 CONC iding in St George Hanover Square, London and his occupation was Gunmake
1 CONC rs Clerk and then in 1911 and residing at 238 Worple Road Wimbledon, Lon
1 CONC don his occupation was Commercial Traveller Fine Cu Printers And Fancy G
1 CONC oods - could Gilbert be working for Henry J Ryman ? If so, could this b
1 CONC e the reason why the Ryman name had been associated with the Richards na
1 CONC me ? 
1 CONT 
1 CONT For me and for the time being, the reason why the name Ryman came in t

1 CONT Dear Laurie and Bryan,
1 CONT         Quite a grand wedding when my greatgrandparents Lilian Jessie Ro

1 CONT         The photo is in the back garden at The Haven, in Herne Bay, whic

1 CONC e groom and bride(her daughter) in the centre of the picture (my greatgr
1 CONC andparents), she is sitting next to her new son-in-law, right in the cen

1 CONT         Sitting on the lawn 5th in from left is I think(I'm not certain

1 CONT  I was interested to see you have Auntie Emmeline's birthday as 28th Dec
1 CONC . I didn't know that, I wonder how you know. But 1866?  Well, I think th

1 CONT             From ''FREE BMD'' website, I have found her birth was alread
1 CONC y registered in the first quarter (already) of 1866, I didn't know it wa
1 CONC s 28th Dec, her birthday, but a 1st quarter registration 1866 would ti
1 CONC e in very well with that if really it was that late in the previous year
1 CONC , 1865, because so late in the year they wouldn't have had the chance t
1 CONC o get her registered until the new year was in. Then it could easily sho

1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Now follows my best account of Ian’s time working in the world of life a
1 CONC ssurance.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I believe that Ian had his first employment in life assurance with Abbe
1 CONC y Life Assurance Company and then, due to Ian’s
1 CONT administrative abilities and expertise with recruiting, training and th
1 CONC e motivation of sales staff and out-standing personal qualities he
1 CONT was asked to join Hambo Life Assurance as one it’s first members soon af
1 CONC ter Mark Weinberg founded it in 1971.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the years ahead Ian was a branch manager (Stoke-On-Trent) with staf
1 CONC f totalling, 2 administrators, 1 field supervisor and 16 Sales
1 CONT Associates. Although the hours where long, Ian loved his work and had bu
1 CONC ilt up a reputation for honest ethical conduct that was
1 CONT second to none and can be verified by letters written to Ian by key peop
1 CONC le within firms and bank, expressing great appreciation and
1 CONT satisfaction for his work ethics and help.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ian’s work and success as branch manager had also made a significant imp
1 CONC ression on his bosses. So much so, that Ian was asked to
1 CONT give a talk (that would last for a half hour) at the companies 1973 sale
1 CONC s conference held in Istanbul. However, in the mid 1970’s the
1 CONT company policies where to change which where to force Ian’s hand in givi
1 CONC ng in his resignation.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Weinberg’s hard-sell and aggressive marketing techniques was about to b
1 CONC e unleashed on to the branch managers. From here on, it
1 CONT would be a numbers game. Ian’s new roll as branch manager would mean th
1 CONC e recruiting of sales staff with little regard of their ability
1 CONT to perform for the long term. Time spent on staff support and training w
1 CONC ould instead be given over to recruiting salesman. Only the
1 CONT highest performing salesman would go on to succeed in the company, leavi
1 CONC ng good quality and ethical salesman with potential to
1 CONT perform equally as well to drop out, as under a changed earnings polic
1 CONC y they would struggle to financially support their families.
1 CONT These new tactics was a call too far for Ian to bring to bear. These tac
1 CONC tics stood for everything that Ian was not, professionally,
1 CONT personally and morally. They would bring further success for Weinberg an
1 CONC d his company but Ian could see no other choice and would
1 CONT have to resign from his position as branch manager.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It would seem that these same tactics that Mark Weinberg deployed in hi
1 CONC s company would go on to be common place through out the
1 CONT industry – [1] His methods - pushy advertising, hard-selling, paying hig
1 CONC h commission to agents sending him business and introducing
1 CONT new unit-linked products - were frowned upon by many.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Ian’s foresight into the way life assurance would be sold into the futur
1 CONC e led him to not only leave Hambro Life but also to leave (with
1 CONT some sadness) the Life Assurance industry altogether.

1 CONT [1] Sir Mark Weinberg, Mark One: senior statesman of the life assuranc
1 CONC e industry, who, with his three companies - Abbey Life,
1 CONT Hambro Life and Allied Dunbar - was closely identified with ushering i
1 CONC n hard-sell and aggressive marketing techniques. Mark One is
1 CONT rich and ambitious, working with his close friend, Jacob Rothschild to m
1 CONC ake even more money from their latest business venture - J
1 CONT Rothschild Assurance. Then there is Weinberg, Mark Two - in many ways
1 CONC , a more interesting figure. This is the campaigner urging
1 CONT companies to donate a proportion of their profits to charity, a tireles
1 CONC s worker for good causes, a large personal charitable donor.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [2] In 1961, Mark Weinberg founded Abbey Life Assurance Company in Londo
1 CONC n, which was one of the first companies to develop
1 CONT unit-linked assurance and where he formed one of the UK’s first retail p
1 CONC roperty funds.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1971, he went on to found Hambro Life Assurance, (subsequently calle
1 CONC d Allied Dunbar) It was first listed on the London Stock
1 CONT Exchange in 1975. The company expanded its financial adviser operation
1 CONC s during the late '70s and early '80s, acquiring the Allied
1 CONT Unit Trusts of which it was soon the major unitholder, to become 'Allie
1 CONC d Hambro' in 1984. At Allied Dunbar, he was managing
1 CONT director until 1983 (it is now part of Zurich Financial Services), opera
1 CONC ting in the insurance broker market as well as building up a
1 CONT sales force. There he formed the first retail managed fund and originate
1 CONC d the concept of the variable premium whole life policy.
