We suspect that Gorringe Terrace was actually Gorringe Park Terrace.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 1892 and 1909/10 Kelly\u2019s directories do not show any street / housing parade of the former name.\n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<p>\nGorringe Park Terrace was a group of four properties, each listed as a shop or hotel:\n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<p>\n1892: Gorringe Park Terrace ( from Tooting Junction Railway Bridge to Figges Marsh )\n</p>\n<p>\nWest Side:\n</p>\n<p>\nGorringe Park Terrace\n</p>\n<p>\n1: Smith, C A  - Cycle maker\n</p>\n<p>\n2: White, W \u2013 Coffee House ( In 1891, this was Francis Gale\u2019s grovery shop. )\n</p>\n<p>\n4: Gorringe Park Hotel \u2013 run by Robert Turner\n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<p>\n1909/10:\n</p>\n<p>\nGorringe Park Parade &amp; terrace\n</p>\n<p>\n1: Davis, Arthur \u2013 cycle maker\n</p>\n<p>\n2: Crocker, Frank William \u2013 confectioner, newsagent.

If you can provide your great grandfather\u2019s name, we may be able to check for this amongst our directory entries.\n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<p>\nGorringe Park Terrace is now 23 \u2013 29 London Road, Mitcham.
